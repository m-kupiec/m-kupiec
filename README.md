# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 14 years of experience in tech, project coordination, and business development. I focus on delivering impactful solutions through client collaboration and modern tech stacks. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and have led projects in areas ranging from research management to nonprofit development.

In recent years, I've specialized in front-end development using frameworks like React and Svelte, with a strong commitment to writing scalable, maintainable code. I apply practices like TDD, type-safe development, and static analysis to every project.
